# Welcome to the Choral documentation

First, please make sure to have [downloaded the Choral compiler](/downloads) 
so that you can try all the examples listed in the documentation.

Once you're ready, you can begin our tutorial starting from 
[Hello Roles](/documentation/basics/hello_roles.html).
