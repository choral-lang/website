# Coming soon

Choral comes with a testing tool, called ChoralUnit, that developers can use to write tests for choreographies that involve many roles (and thus many components) as simple unit tests. Then, the Choral compiler is used to generate a test program for each role and integrate these tests automatically (integration testing).

We are still working on writing this section of the documentation. In the meantime, you can check section "Testing" of our [article](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09520).
