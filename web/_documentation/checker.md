# The Choral code checker

Choral is equipped with a fast static code checker that prevents a series of errors related to choreographic programming, including the following.

- Lack of [knowledge of choice](/documentation/basics/knowledge_of_choice.html).
- Wrong assumptions about the location of data.
- Deadlocks (the code generated by checked Choral code cannot introduce deadlocks).

We are still working on writing this section of the documentation. In the meantime, you can check section 4.1 of our [article](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09520) for a few examples (look out for the red boxes).
