# Install Choral

Choral is packaged as a JAR file. Running the Choral compiler requires Java version 11 or later. Running the Java code generated by the Choral compiler requires Java version 14 or later.

To install Choral in Unix (MacOS/Linux) and Windows (WSL) OSes, you can execute the command below.

<pre class="border p-2 bg-light">curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/choral/choral/src/scripts/install.sh | bash</pre>

The `install.sh` script installs the `choral` command under the folder `/usr/local/bin` and the choral binaries (jar) into under the `/usr/local/lib/choral` folder.

To provide different parameters to the installer, either [download it](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/choral/choral/src/scripts/install.sh) and run it with the command

<pre class="border p-2 bg-light">bash install.sh /path/to/store/the/launcher /path/to/store/the/binaries</pre>

or pass them directly with the command

<pre class="border p-2 bg-light">curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/choral/choral/src/scripts/install.sh | bash -s  /path/to/store/the/launcher /path/to/store/the/binaries</pre>

**Manual Installation**

To manually install Choral, follow the steps below:
- [download the latest release](https://github.com/choral-lang/choral/releases/latest) from the Github repository. Then, you need to unzip the archive;
- move the `choral.jar` found inside the `choral` folder of the archive into your preferred directory for storing program libraries;
- point the environment variable `CHORAL_HOME` to that directory;
- move the `choral` file found inside the `launchers` folder of the archive into the preferred directory for storing program launchers (making sure it has execution rights).
