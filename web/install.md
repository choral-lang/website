# Install Choral

**Note on prerequisites.** Running the Choral compiler requires Java version 11 or later. Running the Java code generated by the Choral compiler requires Java version 14 or later. Choral can be installed in Linux, macOS, and Windows (through WSL) OSes.

## Default directories (fastest method)

To install Choral, paste and run the following command in a terminal.

<pre class="border p-2 bg-light">curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/choral/choral/src/scripts/install.sh | bash</pre>

By default, this will install the `choral` executable launcher in `/usr/local/bin` and the Choral libraries in `/usr/local/lib/choral`.

You might need to run the command above using `sudo` if your user cannot write in `/usr/local` (or you can set custom directories, see below).

## Custom directories

If you want to choose different installation directories, just pass them as arguments to the install script as follows.

<pre class="border p-2 bg-light">curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/choral/choral/src/scripts/install.sh | bash -s /path/to/store/the/launcher /path/to/store/the/binaries</pre>

For example, to install the `choral` launcher in `~/bin` and the Choral libraries in `~/bin/choral-dist`, use the following.

<pre class="border p-2 bg-light">curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/choral/choral/src/scripts/install.sh | bash -s ~/bin ~/bin/choral-dist</pre>

## Manual installation

To manually install Choral, follow the steps below:
- [download the latest release](https://github.com/choral-lang/choral/releases/latest) from the Github repository;
- unzip the ZIP archive, which will give you the subdirectories `launchers` and `dist`;
- move all files inside `launchers` to a directory in your `$PATH`;
- set the environment variable `CHORAL_HOME` to a directory of your choice (this is the directory where we will install the Choral libraries);
- move all files (and subdirectories) inside `dist` to the directory pointed at by `CHORAL_HOME`.

## Choral version

You should be able to check Choral's version by running the following command.

```
$ choral --version
Choral 0.1 (C) 2020 the Choral team
```
